'The ATM on their home island can give only $5 bills, which means that the machine will not give any bill not divisible by $5. In addition to that, the commission for each cashing out is $0.5 + 1% from the withdrawn cash plus the robots cannot go beyond the cardâ€™s balance. After each operation, the bank rounds the balance to lower whole value (57.9 = 57, 61.1 = 61)'
